### iPhone Battery Health Analysis
This project analyzes the iPhone battery health based on regional variants, iPhone models, and conditions. The data used in this analysis was obtained from a survey conducted on iPhone users, which includes information on the battery health percentage, charging patterns, iOS updates, and device conditions. The project aims to identify the factors that affect battery health and provide insights into how users can maintain better battery health.

### Data Cleaning
The first step in the analysis was to clean and preprocess the data. The data cleaning process involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types. The data was then transformed to make it more suitable for analysis.

### Data Visualization
The second step was to visualize the data to gain insights into the factors that affect battery health. Various data visualization techniques such as scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps were used to analyze the data. The visualizations helped to identify trends and patterns in the data and provide insights into the factors that affect battery health.

### Statistical Analysis
The third step involved conducting statistical analysis to test the significance of the factors identified in the data visualization. The F-test was used to determine if there is a significant difference in battery health between different iPhone models and regional variants. The results of the statistical analysis provided further insights into the factors that affect battery health.

### Conclusion
The analysis showed that the battery health of iPhones tends to degrade over time, particularly for previous versions of iPhone models. The analysis also showed that factors such as charging patterns, device conditions, and iOS updates can significantly affect battery health. Based on these findings, it is recommended that iPhone users follow specific charging patterns to maintain better battery health.
