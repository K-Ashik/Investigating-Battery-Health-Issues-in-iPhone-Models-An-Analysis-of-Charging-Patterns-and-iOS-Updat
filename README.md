## iPhone Battery Health Analysis
### Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze the battery health percentage of different iPhone models over different iOS updates and regions. The data used for this analysis was collected through an online survey, in which participants were asked to provide information about their iPhone models, regions, iOS versions, battery health, and battery issues. The purpose of this project is to provide insights and recommendations on how to maintain better battery health for iPhone users.

### Data Analysis Process
The data analysis process involved the following steps:

#### Data Cleaning: The original dataset contained some incomplete and inconsistent data. Therefore, data cleaning was performed to remove missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

#### Data Exploration: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the data. The following visualizations were created:

Distribution Counterplot of iPhone Models
Distribution Counterplot of Battery Issues
Stacked Bar Chart of Battery Issues over Regional Variant iPhone Models
Heatmap Comparison of Battery Health Percentage Current, Percentage Level of Device on Charging, and Percentage Level of Device Unplug from Charge
Stacked Bar Chart of Distribution of Battery Issues over Regional Variant, Model, and Current iOS based on the Condition of the Devices
Statistical Analysis: One-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test was performed to determine whether there were significant differences in battery health percentage among different iPhone models over different iOS updates.

### Findings
Based on the data analysis, the following findings were obtained:

iPhone battery health percentage is degrading over the previous model of iPhones over any iOS updates.
Most of the devices which are facing significant battery health down are from either USA or Japan variant.
Most of the devices that have battery issues are either previous versions of models or used conditioned phones.
Only 20-25% of users from our survey had battery issues.
Those who maintain the charging pattern range in between 20-30% & 80-90% or 90-100% tend to have sufficient battery health percentages.
The previous version of devices and the condition of the devices have a greater impact on battery degradation.
### Conclusion
Based on the findings, it is recommended that iPhone users should follow certain best practices to maintain better battery health. These practices include:

Maintaining the charging pattern range between 20-30% & 80-90% or 90-100%.
Upgrading to the latest iPhone models to avoid significant battery health degradation.
Taking good care of the iPhone's condition to avoid battery issues.
Overall, this analysis provides valuable insights for iPhone users on how to maintain better battery health for their devices.
